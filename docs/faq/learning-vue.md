A good grasp of JavaScript, HTML and CSS is important before you start learning Vue. In particular, you will really struggle if you don't have a solid understanding of JavaScript syntax. TypeScript is optional, but if you intend to use it then you'll need to have a good grasp of the basics.

For Vue itself, start with the official docs, <https://vuejs.org/>. In particular, the **Essentials** and **Components In-Depth** sections of the guide are really important material that everybody needs to read. It won't all sink in the first time, but don't let that put you off. There's also a **Tutorial**, which is a bit more hands on and which covers the most important points in less depth than the main guide. You might want to try the **Tutorial** first to get an overview and then use the guide to fill in the gaps.

<https://vueschool.io/> and <https://www.vuemastery.com/> both provide video courses for learning Vue. <https://www.udemy.com/> also has a range of Vue courses. Videos can be a good way to learn high-level concepts, but they aren't a replacement for reading the documentation. Watching videos is easier than reading documentation, but that doesn't necessarily equate to better learning.

Practice is also essential. For most people its *doing* rather than *reading* or *watching* that really makes the knowledge stick. Ideally, you should avoid trying to write a large application straight away. Instead, write something small, with the sole purpose of testing and reinforcing your Vue knowledge. Maybe try tweaking some of the interactive playground examples in the official docs, to check that you've understood them correctly.
