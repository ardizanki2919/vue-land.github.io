# FAQ

This FAQ aims to answer some of the most common programming questions that we get on the [Vue Land Discord server](https://chat.vuejs.org/).

It is not a substitute for the official Vue documentation, available at <https://vuejs.org/>. Those docs include an FAQ for Vue itself at <https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html>.

::: warning Work in progress
We've only just started work on this FAQ and most of the answers will be incomplete. Some questions don't really have an answer yet, they're just placeholders.
